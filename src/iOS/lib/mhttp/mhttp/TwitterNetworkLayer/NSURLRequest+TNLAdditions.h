/**
 With HTTP, a request encapsulates "what" is being sent.
 With `NSURLRequest`, however, it encapsulates a little more too, such
 as the TCP host to connect to.

 First, the DNS will be resolved for the `[NSURL host]` of `[NSURLRequest URL]`.
 That resolution will lead to an IP address to make the TCP connection with.
 The `NSURLRequest` will then be sent with a `@"Host"` header indicating the
 name of the host, which is decoupled from the actual host being connected to.
 Because of this, it can be useful to identify what the HTTP request `Host` is
 separate from the TCP connection's host.

 This method will return the `@"Host"` HTTP header field value, if populated.
 If `@"Host"` is unset, the method will return the `[NSURL host]` value since
 that is the value that the __NSURL__ stack will use instead.

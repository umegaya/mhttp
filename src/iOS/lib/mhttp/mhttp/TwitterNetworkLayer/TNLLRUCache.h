/**
 `TNLLRUCache` is a collection object that maintains a set of `TNLLRUEntry` objects.
 You can look up an entry by identifier in constant time and it maintains the entries so that you
 can remove the least-recently-used (LRU) entry.

 @warning This class is exposed as a convenience to consumers that might be able to take advantage
 of an LRU collection.
 It is not permanent though and may eventually move to a shared core utilities library that TNL
 will depend on.
 It is recommended to NOT use this class unless you are prepared to migrate to a shared core
 utilities library if one is created.

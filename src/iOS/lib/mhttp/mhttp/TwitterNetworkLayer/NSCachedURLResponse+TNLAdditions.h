 If the target  contains an `NSHTTPURLResponse` as a `response`, the `response` will be tagged that
 it is cached by TNL.

 _TwitterNetworkLayer_ will automatically tag any cached responses that it encounters so that on
 response receipt in a subsequent operation that would hit the cache it can detect that the response
 was a cache hit so that `[TNLResponseInfo source]` will be `TNLResponseSourceLocalCache`.

 If _TNL_ is run alongside another networking stack and an `NSURLCache` can be shared, then the
 consumer should take the necessary steps to:
   1. flag any cached responses
   2. (if desired) detect cached responses with `[NSURLResponse tnl_wasCachedResponse]`.

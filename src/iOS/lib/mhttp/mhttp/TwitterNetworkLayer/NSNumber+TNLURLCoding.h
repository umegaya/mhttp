/**
 `NSNumber(TNLURLCoding)` is a category on `NSNumber` to add helpers for encoding  support.
 TNL treats `NSNumber` as a first class object for encoding. The encoding of an `NSNumber` is based
 on the `TNLURLEncodableDictionaryOptionReplaceDictionariesWithDictionariesOfEncodableStrings`
 option being present or not.

 ## Custom encoding of numbers

 If a consumer wishes to encode a number in a different way the consumer can use a different object
 instead of an `NSNumber`.
 For convenience, `TNLBoolean` is provided so that the object can be encoded as `@"true"` or
 `@"false"` based on the `boolValue` of the object always, regardless of encoding format or options.
